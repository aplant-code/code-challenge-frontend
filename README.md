# TODO Items

- Unit tests - ran out of time...
- Ensure buttons stay highlighted once filter is applied
- Implement time until race as a countdown timer (like on the site), and apply timezone correctly
- Add a refresh component - either through a button trigged by the user, or polling of the S3 bucket
- Remove partial inline CSS (due to time running out)

# Requirements
Requires Angular CLI - https://cli.angular.io/, Node.js, and npm. The command 'npm install' should be executed initially, before running the below.

Once the 'npm install' command has completed, you can start the server using the command 'ng serve'
